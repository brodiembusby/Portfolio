# Overview

* This sprint I took a simpler route than my first one and I used pygame to make a simple pick up and gain points game. You need to pick up the key to get a chest of gold which gives points to the user. I found this a lot easier to build with that C++ and this is only a starter game that I want to spring off of into something easier and more complex.
