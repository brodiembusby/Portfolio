# Overview

This intro program was the first of a couple two week sprints that I am trying to accomplish. I tried learning C++ while following along with a helpful video series.

This program is it's own game engine with its own functions for setting up a player, creating buffering, all while using the windows application.

For this project I definitely bit off more than I could chew for it and will have to come back to it once I finish my other sprints.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio

C++

# Useful Websites


* The MSDN sites were a massive help as well because they tell you which functions to use and the various parameters that you can put on for them.
- [WNDPROC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nc-winuser-wndproc)
* Dan Zaidan's videos on making a C++ game helped massively with this and helped me learn pages worth of content.

# Future Work

* I need to fix and add a lot of things here's a few.

- Item 1: I started on bullets which would come out of either side of the player. I want these to bounce of the walls.
- Item 2: Collision for the character. 
- Item 3: I would also like to be able to put images over the rectangles instead of just squares.
