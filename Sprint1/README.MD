This intro program was the first of a couple two week sprints that I am trying to accomplish. I tried learning C++ while following along with a helpful video series.

This program is it's own game engine with its own functions for setting up a player, creating buffering, all while using the windows application.

For this project I definitely bit off more than I could chew for it and will have to come back to it once I finish my other sprints.
