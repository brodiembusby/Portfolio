# Overview

* This sprint was a dip of the toes into understanding how to visualize data and how to make it appear visually appealing while also showing something i'm interested in.

* This data set(linked below) is one of the newer Starcraft 2 data sets. Which is a game I quite enjoy playing and is easy to play but very hard to master.

# Data Analysis Results

* My main two questions I wanted to answer with this data set is APM(Actions Per Minute) important and general age group play time.

* My first question about APM was about what I expected. The better ranked you are the higher the APM. What surprised more though was Action Latency. It wasn't something I was looking at first but, it makes sense that the better you are even with more "excess" clicks. Shows that the higher ranked the more valuable your time is doing something on the screen.

* My second question showed that on average in the multiple age groups 20-30 had the most random play time and 16-20 had the most dedicated time to the game. One thing that did suprise me was 12-16 some how there is one player out there that forgot to turn his game off or has the ability to play for every hour of the day.

# Development Environment

* VScode
* Python
* pip(matplotlib,numpy,and pandas)
~ Each have to be downloaded on your system

# Useful Websites

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)
* [Data Set Used](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushnitb/starcraft-players-dataset)

# Future Work

* There are a lot of details in the dataset. Which means that there is a lot of data that can be sifted and used.
* Merge this to Jupyter lab so I can have updatable graphs rather than the two that I have.
* Sort the float64 data types. Most of these graphs are based on Int64 which the data is focused on different entities entirely
