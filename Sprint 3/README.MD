# Overview

* This sprint was a exercise in basic C. It was ver confusing at first because I never used C or Eclipse before but, after a lot of confusion I got something im pretty proud of.

# Development Environment

* Eclipse
* C Language

# Useful Websites
* [GeekforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/)

# Future Work

* Right now the card set is not randomized each time but just a single time and then in plays out. IT could be cool to learn how to shuffle the cards so each time it is completely new.
