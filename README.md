# Portfolio
A group of sprints each of about two weeks at a time to push my experience

* The introduction is just a small demonstration on how the sprints will be set up. Just a simple function saying hello world in python.

* Sprint 1 was a learning experience in C++. My first ever experience coding in that language and with Visual Studio. 
* Sprint 2 is war the card game in basic C. Where two "AI"(not really) play a full game out.
* Sprint 3 was a learning experience with Pygame. I was more familiar with VScode so it was fun to get back into something I understand.
* Sprint 4 was a learning experience with Pandas and matplotlib. Learning how to work with datasets and displayin the results
