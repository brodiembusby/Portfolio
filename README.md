A group of sprints each of about two weeks at a time to push my experience

* The introduction is just a small demonstration on how the sprints will be set up. Just a simple function saying hello world in python.

* Sprint 1 was a learning experience in C++. My first ever experience coding in that language and with Visual Studio.
